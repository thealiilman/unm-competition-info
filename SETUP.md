# Setup
This setup assumes you'll be using CodeSandbox to build an application. CodeSandbox is a platform where we can jump right into building an application straightaway by removing the need for us to install programs that are required to run other programs on our machines.

It is **not** mandatory to use CodeSandbox. You can build from scratch or even use alternatives like [CodePen](https://codepen.io/). CodePen is similar to CodeSandbox but CodePen only allows you to build user interfaces, what the user can see. Feel free to skip this setup if you're not using CodeSandbox.

## 1. How to create a CodeSandbox account
We can use either a GitHub account or a Google account for CodeSandbox.

Visit this page to create a CodeSandbox account. https://codesandbox.io/signin

## 2. How to build a project from our template
We have set-up a template for you to use so that you can get going with the necessary dependencies. To build a project from the template, the steps are as followed.
  
1. Visit https://codesandbox.io/s/template-for-unm-competition-lm4wx
2. In the navbar, click the _Fork_ button

And there we go! Now you can start building an application.

Should you wish to build together with other people, then share a _live session_ for your sandbox.
