### Accessibility
What is accessibility?

It's the practice of making our applications usable to as many people as possible.

Most of the time, we'll find out that the process is straightforward as we only need to use proper semantics / the proper HTML elements to make our applications accessible. A product's target market is not an excuse to not build accessible applications.

We suggest reading the following articles to learn more about accessibility.

- [HTML: A good basis for accessibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML)
- [CSS and JavaScript accessibility best practices](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/CSS_and_JavaScript)

### Design
There's more to design than crafting beautiful shapes.

The content of a page should be structured neatly and be easy to ead.

We suggest reading [_Design Principles for Developers: Processes and CSS Tips for Better Web Design_](https://css-tricks.com/design-principles-for-developers-processes-and-css-tips-for-better-web-design/) for design tips.

### Functionality
As a user of the application, I should be able to do the following.

1. Submit data that is saved into the database
2. View data that is retrieved from the database
3. Update existing data
4. Delete data

### _Impress Me_ (???)
This can be anything you feel like adding into the application.

### Responsiveness
Responsiveness is how the design of an application responds to changes in environment. These changes can be screen width and screen height, to name a few. Responsiveness is closely-related to accessibility.

Nowadays, there tend to be applications that are usable on desktops, laptops, tablets and mobile phones. This is made possible thanks to responsive design.

We suggest reading the following articles for tips and tricks on building responsive applications.e
