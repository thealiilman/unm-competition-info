## Specifications

### Accessibility (5 points)
What is accessibility?

It's the practice of making our applications usable to as many people as possible.

Most of the time, we'll find out that the process is straightforward as we only need to use proper semantics / the proper HTML elements to make our applications accessible. A product's target market is not an excuse to not build accessible applications.

We suggest reading the following articles to learn more about accessibility.

- [HTML: A good basis for accessibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML)
- [CSS and JavaScript accessibility best practices](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/CSS_and_JavaScript)

### Design (5 points)
There's more to design than crafting beautiful shapes.

The content of a page should be structured neatly and be easy to read.

We suggest reading [_Design Principles for Developers: Processes and CSS Tips for Better Web Design_](https://css-tricks.com/design-principles-for-developers-processes-and-css-tips-for-better-web-design/) for design tips.

### Responsiveness (5 points)
Responsiveness is how the design of an application responds to changes in environment. These changes can be screen width and screen height, to name a few. Responsiveness is closely-related to accessibility.

Nowadays, there tend to be applications that are usable on desktops, laptops, tablets and mobile phones. This is made possible thanks to responsive design.

We suggest reading the following articles for tips and tricks on building responsive applications.
- [Responsive design](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design)
- [The Beginner’s Guide to Responsive Web Design (Code Samples & Layout Examples)](https://kinsta.com/blog/responsive-web-design/)

1. Submit data that is saved into the database
2. View data that is retrieved from the database
3. Update existing data
4. Delete data

### Impress Me (5 points)
This can be anything really, and solely up to the judges discretion. Here are some ideas that may impress us.

- Geolocation to detect user's location and use the user's location to filter data
- Drag an item and drop it at a box that destroys it
- User can sign up, log in, log out
- A stunning design
- Any other added (but useful) functionality

Therefore each submission will receive a score out of 30 points.
